Algorithm Description:







Input Files Description:
We found a paper written by C. H. Papadimitriou and K. Steiglitz written
in 1978 titled "Some examples of Difficult Traveling Salesman Problems".
In the paper, the authors gave examples of graphs that had many local optima,
so that the graphs should be difficult for local search algorithms in general.
We took these graphs, assigned colors to each of the nodes, and added some
edges to obtain our inputs.
